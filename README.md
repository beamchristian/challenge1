# Code Refactor Horiseon Social Solution Services

This projects purpose was to refactor the code that was given to have semantic tags and to clean up the code overall.

## Semantic Tags I Added
* Section with Classes
* Header
* Footer
* Nav

I cleaned up the code by adding commentation to "index.html" and combining rules in "style.css" that shared the same declarations.
